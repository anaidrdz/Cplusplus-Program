# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project required the programmer to build a simple program that would calculate the end result of an investment bank account with user inputed variables.

# What did you do particularly well?
The display of the bank account information to the user is neatly organized and easily readable.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One of the most important enhacements I would like to do is handling more invalid user inputs including special characters and words.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part to write was the organizing of the information to display neatly. I wanted all the decimals to align and wanted every number outputted with two decimal places. I learned different ways to display numbers and information in general through quick readings through w3schools.com

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The most important skill learned from this project was the usage of header and cpp files as well as working with multiple header and cpp files in one project and making them all work together.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I commented on all methods and all the necessary steps needed in order to output the correct and organized information.
